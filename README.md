# Audio-Amplifier
An LM386 audio amplifier stands as a vital electronic device meticulously crafted to magnify the 
magnitude of an input audio signal. Its fundamental purpose lies in taking a feeble electrical signal 
or waveform and skillfully reproducing a more potent rendition at the output, all orchestrated by 
tapping into an external power source. Amplifiers, a diverse category of electronic marvels, neatly 
fall into three classifications based on their transformative impact on input signals: Current 
Amplifiers, Voltage Amplifiers, and the focus of our exploration, Power Amplifiers
